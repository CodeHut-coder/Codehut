# Simple space invader game
A very simple spaceinvaders game anyone can make without images

In this game an enemy goes down every time it reaches the end.
You as a player presses space to shoot and left right arrow keys

Everytime you hit the target it goes back to the starting position and your score gets increased by 10

If you get hit... well.

good luck
